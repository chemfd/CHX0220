## Thermodynamics of binding

We can also express this just in terms of *either* bound or unbound concentration of receptor if we know the total concentration ($[R]_{\textrm{tot}}$) of receptor in solution:

<p align="center">
$K_d = \frac{[R][L]}{[R \bullet L]} = \frac{([R]_{\textrm{tot}}-[R \bullet L])[L]}{[R \bullet L]}$
</p>

We can now express the fractional occupancy of binding sites, $F_b$ (fraction occupied divided by total number of binding sites):

<p align="center">
$F_b = \frac{[R \bullet L]}{[R]_{\textrm{tot}}}$
</p>

which rearranging we can express as:

<p align="center">
$F_b = \frac{[L]}{K_d+[L]}$
</p>

## Thermodynamics of binding

This is all very nice, but we need to be able to determine values for the equilibrium constant (or at least values of the concentrations of bound or unbound form)

This course will address this, and talk about a number of natural and synthetic binding complex systems...
