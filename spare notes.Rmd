## Thermodynamics of binding

We can also express this just in terms of *either* bound or unbound concentration of receptor if we know the total concentration ($[R]_{\textrm{tot}}$) of receptor in solution:

<p align="center">
$K_d = \frac{[R][L]}{[R \bullet L]} = \frac{([R]_{\textrm{tot}}-[R \bullet L])[L]}{[R \bullet L]}$
</p>

We can now express the fractional occupancy of binding sites, $F_b$ (fraction occupied divided by total number of binding sites):

<p align="center">
$F_b = \frac{[R \bullet L]}{[R]_{\textrm{tot}}}$
</p>

which rearranging we can express as:

<p align="center">
$F_b = \frac{[L]}{K_d+[L]}$
</p>


Workshop week 7

What info do we get when r = 0.5?
