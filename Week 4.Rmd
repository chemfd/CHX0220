## DNA bases

DNA is (usually) composed of four different heterocyclic bases:

- the purines:

```{r echo=FALSE, purines, out.width='40%', fig.show='hold', fig.align='center', fig.cap='The purine bases of DNA: guanine (G) left and adenine (A), right.'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/purines.png")
```

- the pyrimidines

```{r echo=FALSE, pyrimidines, out.width='40%', fig.show='hold', fig.align='center', fig.cap='The pyrimidine bases of DNA: cytosine (C) left and thymine (T), right.'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/pyrimidines.png")
```

bound to a sugar  and phosphate group (R).

## Nucleotides

```{r echo=FALSE, dG, out.width='30%', fig.show='hold', fig.align='center', fig.cap='The purine base guanosine bound to the deoxyribose sugar and phosphate, the polymer is a repeat of the unit with a bond connecting the dashed lines'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/dG.png")
```

Polymer DNA is formed by polymerisation along the sugar phosphate backbone (phosphodiester bonds).

The DNA has 'direction' due to this asymmetry of the sugar phosphate backbone.


## GC Base Pairing

```{r echo=FALSE, GCbasepair, out.width='40%', fig.show='hold', fig.align='center', fig.cap='The base pairing between guanine and cytosine with three hydrogen bonds. Note one of the bases is flipped over, due to the two strands running antiparallel.'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/GCbasepair.png")
```


## AT Base Pairing

```{r echo=FALSE, ATbasepair, out.width='40%', fig.show='hold', fig.align='center', fig.cap='The base pairing between adenine and thymine with just two hydrogen bonds. Note one of the bases is flipped over, due to the two strands running antiparallel.'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ATbasepair.png")
```


## DNA duplexing

```{r echo=FALSE, DNAmelt, out.width='40%', fig.show='hold', fig.align='center', fig.cap='As the temperature increases the absorbance of a sample of DNA also increaes, this is due to melting of the DNA duplex, and loss of quadrupole π interactions between the stacked base pairs.'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/DNAmelt.png")
```

We know that there is a temperature dependence of absorption when a solution of DNA is heated.

The melting temperature T~m~ is the temperature 'halfway between the turning points'.

## DNA duplexing

However the 'melting temperature' is not just a property of the number of hydrogen bonds between base pairs.

For example the melting temperature of poly(dA)・poly(dT) is higher than poly[d(AT)]・poly[d(TA)].

The stability of DNA duplexing is down to both the base pairs & the base sequence.

## Sequence specific effects on the enthalpy of duplexing

The enthalpy of hybridisation is given by:


$\Delta H_{\textrm{total}}= \Delta h_i  + \sum_x \Delta h_x$

where 

- $\Delta h_i$ is the initiation enthalpy (which can reasonably be assumed to be zero)
- $\Delta h_x$ is the contribution from each of the base sequence combinations

## Sequence specific effects on the free energy of duplexing

A similar process can be used to determine the free energy of duplexing

$\Delta G_{\textrm{total}}= -(\Delta g_i+ \Delta g_{\textrm{sym}})  + \sum_x \Delta g_x$

in this case the helix initiation free energy ($\Delta g_i$) can be assumed to be around 20 kJ mol^-1^ for duplexes containing GC and 24 kJ mol^-1^ for sequences exclusively containing AT base pairs.

The  term $\Delta g_{\textrm{sym}}$ is 1.6 kJ mol^-1^ for 'self complementary' sequences and 0 otherwise.
