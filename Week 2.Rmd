## Supramolecular Chemisty

*'chemistry beyond the molecule'*

- molecular systems that are held together reversibly using intermolecular interactions (*not* covalent bonds)

## Supramolecular Chemistry

- seen a lot of examples of cation binding

    -- transition metal complexes

    -- EDTA (group II metals, Fe$^{3+}$, Pb$^{2+}$, Hg$^{2+}$, Mn$^{2+}$)

    -- macrocycles (porphoryns - chlorophyll, haem)

Many complexing agents are not selective

## From mistakes great chemistry comes

```{r echo=FALSE, pedersensyn, out.width='80%', fig.show='hold', fig.align='center', fig.cap='The proposed mechanism for the synthesis of a copper or vanadium binding complex.'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/pedersonsyn.png")
```
   
## From mistakes great chemistry comes

Charles J. Pedersen actually made:

\

```{r echo=FALSE, dibenzo18crown6, out.width='50%', fig.show='hold', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Dibenzo[18]crown-6.'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/dibenzo18crown6.png")
```

The sodium had helped template this *new* molecule.

## Crown ethers

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='30%', fig.show='hold', fig.align='center', fig.cap='[12]crown-4.'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/12crown4.png")
```

Crown ethers are systematically named:

- number of atoms in the macrocycle <span style="color:crimson">[X]</span>

- number of oxygens in the ring <span style="color:crimson">-y </span>
